<p align="center"> Welcome to the Titanic Classification project repository! This project aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. It serves as a classic introductory machine learning project for those interested in data science and predictive modeling. </p>

## About the Project 💻

[![Titanic_Classification_Product_Screenshot](assets/titanic-home-screenshot.jpg)](assets/titanic-home-screenshot.jpg)

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project attempts to predict whether a given passenger survived or not using machine learning algorithms. 

Key components of this project include: 

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
- **Unique Feature Engineering:** **Unique Feature Engineering** to extract passenger titles for predictive modeling.
- **Custom Multivariate Visualization:** **Custom Multivariate Visualization** analyzing survival by Embarkation port and Gender.
- Model selection and training.
- Model evaluation and performance metrics.
